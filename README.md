# Symbolic small singal analysis tool

This tool was created to help with (often lengthy) symbolic small-signal calculations on
circuits. It may be used to verify hand-made calculations, or to completely replace them.

It supports passive elements (including inductors and capacitors), and dependent
current sources, which is more than enough for most applications -- including transistor
circuits.

# How to use it?

# How does it work?

It just solves some nodal equations symbolically with the help of
[SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).
